    -TwoSum
        -take an Array and the target
        -itrate on each element in the array
        -if the sum of two elements equals to the target, return the two indices of these elements
        -if there is no indices of two numbers add up to the target return null


Outputs:
    The indices of two numbers from the array that add up to the target
